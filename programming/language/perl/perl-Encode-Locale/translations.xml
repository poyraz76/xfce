        <Summary xml:lang="en">NAME::Encode::Locale - Determine the locale encoding</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still byte based. Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the program from the outside and encode them again on the way out.</Description>
